While the comprehensive policy model that ACI utilizes is broad, the goal of
this chapter is to introduce the reader to a basic level of understanding
about the model, what it contains and how to work with it. The complete object
model contains a vast amount of information that represents a complete
hierarchy of data center interactions, so it is recommended that the reader
take the time to review the many white papers available on cisco.com, or for
the most extensive information resource available, review the APIC Management
Information Model Reference packaged with the APIC itself.

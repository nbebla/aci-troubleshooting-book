Atomic Counters
===============

Atomic counters can be configured to monitor endpoint/EPG to endpoint/EPG
traffic within a tenant for identifying and isolating traffic loss. Once
configured, the packet counters on a configured policy are updated every 30
seconds. Atomic counters are valid when endpoints reside on different leaf
nodes.

Everything is an Object
=======================

The abstracted model utilized in ACI is object-oriented, and everything in the
model is represented as an object, each with properties relevant to that
object. As is typical for an object-oriented system, these objects can be
grouped, classed, read, and manipulated, and objects can be created
referencing other objects. These objects can reference relevant application
components as well as relationships between these components. The rest of this
section will describe the elements of the model, the objects inside, and their
relationships at a high level.

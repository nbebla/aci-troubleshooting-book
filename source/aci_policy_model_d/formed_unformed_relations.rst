Formed and Unformed Relationships
=================================

In creating objects and forming their relationships within the ACI fabric, a
relationship is expressed when an object is a provider of a service, and
another object is a consumer of that provided service. If a relationship is
formed and one side of the service is not connected, the relationship would be
considered to be unformed. If a consumer exists with no provider, or a
provider exists with no consumer, this would be an unformed relationship. If
both a consumer and provider exist and are connected for a specific service,
that relationship is fully formed.

We are truly grateful to our book sprint facilitators Laia Ros and Adam Hyde
for carrying us throughout this collaborative knowledge production process,
and to our illustrator Henrik van Leeuwen who took abstract ideas and was able
to depict those ideas into clear visuals. Our first concern was how to take so
many people from different sides of the business to complete a project that
traditionally takes months. The book sprint team showed that this is possible
and presents a new model for how we collaborate, extract knowledge and
experience and present it into a single source.

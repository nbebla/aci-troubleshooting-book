Book Writing Methodology
------------------------

The Book Sprint (www.booksprints.net) methodology was used for writing this
book. The Book Sprint methodology is an innovative new style of cooperative
and collaborative authorship. Book Sprints are strongly facilitated and
leverage team-oriented inspiration and motivation to rapidly deliver large
amounts of well authored and reviewed content, and incorporate it into a
complete narrative in a short amount of time. By leveraging the input of many
experts, the complete book was written in a short time period of only five
days, however involved hundreds of authoring man hours, and included thousands
of experienced engineering hours, allowing for extremely high quality in a
very short production time period.

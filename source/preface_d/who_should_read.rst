Who Should Read This Book?
--------------------------

Expected Audience
+++++++++++++++++

The intended audience for this book is those with a general need to understand
how to operate and/or troubleshoot an ACI fabric. While operation engineers may
experience the largest benefit from this content, the materials included herein
may be of use to a much wider audience, especially given modern industry trends
towards continuous integration and development, along with the ever growing
need for agile DevOps oriented methodologies.

There are many elements in this book that explore topics outside the typical
job responsibilities of network administrators. For example the programmatic
manipulation of policy models can be viewed as a development-oriented task,
however has specific relevance to networking configuration and function,
taking a very different approach than traditional CLI-based interface
configuration.

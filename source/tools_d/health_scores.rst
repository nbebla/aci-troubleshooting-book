Health Scores
=============

The APIC manages and automates the underlying forwarding components and Layer
4 to Layer 7 service devices. Using visibility into both the virtual and
physical infrastructure, as well as the knowledge of the application
end-to-end based on the application profile, the APIC can calculate an
application health score. This health score represents the network health of
the application across virtual and physical resources, including Layer 4 to
Layer 7 devices. The score includes failures, packet drops, and other
indicators of system health.

The health score provides enhanced visibility on both application and tenant
levels. The health score can drive further value by being used to trigger
automated events at specific thresholds. This ability allows the network to
respond automatically to application health by making changes before users are
impacted.

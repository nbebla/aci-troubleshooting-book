Virtual Machine Manager and UCS
===============================

Overview

Virtual Machine Manager integration allows for the fabric to extend network policy and policy group definitions into virtual switches residing on a hypervisor. This integration automates critical network plumbing steps that typically stand as delays in the deployment of virtual and compute resources, by automatically configuring the required fabric side and hypervisor virtual switch encapsulation.

The general hierarchy of VMM configuration is as shown in the diagram below:



Problem Description

When attached to a Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect, two hosts are unable to reach one another or unable to resolve one another’s MAC addresses.

Symptom 1
Packet captures running on the sending host, show that it is in fact being transmitted, however it never reaches the destination host. Creating static ARP entries on both devices for one another shows that traffic allowed by policy is able to be exchanged via ICMP, etc.

The UCS Fabric Interconnect is configured with two uplinks that are configured as disjoint layer-2 domains.

Verification

The problem in this situation is that the UCS FI has two uplinks with disjoint layer-2, where the VLAN that is being used for the ARP is using the non-ACI uplink as the designated forwarder. This means that the fabric will not receive the ARP frames and as a result cannot unicast them to the host. The easiest way to determine if this problem is impacting the environment, is to use the following command on the UCS FI in NX-OS mode, substituting the VLAN ID for the one that is attached to the EPG. This can be determined by using the "show platform software enm internal info vlandb id <vlan>" command as shown below:



FI-A(nxos)# show platform software enm internal info vlandb id 248

vlan_id 248
-------------
Designated receiver: Po103
Membership:
Po103
FI-A(nxos)#
 

If the designated receiver is not the port-channel facing the ACI fabric, the uplink pinning settings in LAN manager will need to be adjusted. Use the LAN Uplink Manager in UCS to set the VLANs dedicated to ACI use to be pinned to the ACI fabric facing uplink.

For more information, please reference the Network Configuration section on Configuring LAN Pin Groups in the Cisco UCS Manager GUI Configuration Guide.

 

Symptom 2
ARP requests are egressing ESX host on UCS blade, but not making it to the destination
VM hosted on C-series appliance directly attached to fabric is able to reach the BD anycast gateway
VM hosted on B-series chassis blade attached to fabric is unable to reach the BD anycast gateway
Verification

In this situation there are two VMs, one on a UCS blade chassis and another on a C200, and they are unable to ping one another, while on the same EPG. The C200 VM is able to ping the unicast gateway, however the UCS blade hosted VM is not able to ping the gateway.

The vSphere 5.5 pktcap-uw tool can be used to determine if outbound ARP requests are in fact leaving the VM and hitting the virtual switch.

By monitoring the packet count on the Veth### interface on the UCS in NX-OS mode, it is possible to confirm the packets were being received.

This indicates that traffic is egressing the ESX host, however not making it through to the leaf. One possible cause for this is that the frames are being tagged on upon leaving the ESX host, however are being stripped and placed on the native VLAN. The UCS configuration, specifically VLAN manager, can be checked and verified if VLAN 602 is incorrectly set as the native VLAN.



This means that frames egressing the UCS FI would be untagged heading towards the fabric, and thus would not be categorized into the appropriate EPG. By unmarking the VLAN as native, the frames are properly tagged and then categorized as being members of the EPG, and ICMP can immediately begin to function.



Problem Description

Virtual Machine Manager function is unable to register vCenter with APIC 

Symptom
When attempting to register a vCenter with APIC, one or more of the following faults is raised:

F606262 [FSM:FAILED]: VMM Add-Controller FSM: comp/prov-VMware/ctrlr-[RTPACILab]-TestVcenter Failed to retrieve ServiceContent from the vCenter server 10.122.253.152(FSM:ifc:vmmmgr:CompCtrlrAdd)
F606351 [FSM:FAILED]: Task for updating comp:PolCont(TASK:ifc:vmmmgr:CompPolContUpdateCtrlrPol)
F16438 [FSM:STAGE:FAILED]: Establish connection Stage: comp/prov-VMware/ctrlr-[RTPACILab]-TestVcenter Failed to retrieve ServiceContent from the vCenter server 10.122.253.152(FSM-STAGE:ifc:vmmmgr:CompCtrlrAdd:Connect)


Verification

These faults typically indicate that there is an issue reaching vCenter from the APIC. Typical causes for this include:

The VMM is configured to use the Out of Band management (OOBM) network to access vCenter however is on a separate subnet and has no route to reach that vCenter
The IP address entered for the vCenter is incorrect
Log into the APIC and attempt a simple ping test to the remote vCenter:

 
admin@RTP_Apic1:~> ping 10.122.253.152
PING 10.122.253.152 (10.122.253.152) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 64.102.253.234 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 64.102.253.234 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From 64.102.253.234 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
From 64.102.253.234 icmp_seq=4 Destination Host Unreachable
^C


In this case vCenter is not reachable from the APIC. By default the APIC will use the OOB interface for reaching remotely managed devices, so this would indicate that there is either a misconfiguration on the APIC or that the vCenter is unreachable by that address.

The first step is to verify if a proper default route is configured. This can be verified by navigating to the Tenants section, entering the mgmt tenant, and then inspecting the Node Management Addresses. If out of band management node management addresses have been configured, verify that the proper default gateway has been entered in that location.

 



 

 

The default gateway is configured as 10.122.254.254/24

admin@RTP_Apic1:~> ping 10.122.254.254
PING 10.122.254.254 (10.122.254.254) 56(84) bytes of data.
From 10.122.254.211 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From 10.122.254.211 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From 10.122.254.211 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
From 10.122.254.211 icmp_seq=4 Destination Host Unreachable
^C


The Unreachable state indicates that the gateway is improperly configured, and this misconfiguration can be corrected by setting it to the appropriate 10.122.254.1.

After modifying the configured Out-of-Band gateway address:

admin@RTP_Apic1:~> ping 10.122.254.152
PING 10.122.254.152 (10.122.254.152) 56(84) bytes of data.

Now it is possible to verify that the vCenter VMM is reachable:

 



Symptom 2
The following fault is raised in the VMM manager

F16438 [FSM:STAGE:FAILED]: Establish connection Stage: comp/prov-VMware/ctrlr-[RTPACILab]-172.31.222.24 Failed to find datacenter BldgE in vCenter(FSM-STAGE:ifc:vmmmgr:CompCtrlrAdd:Connect)

Verification

Ensure that the datacenter name in vCenter matches the "Datacenter" property configured in the VMM Controller policy configuration



In the above screenshot, the Datacenter name is purposely misconfigured as BldgE instead of BldgF



Problem Description

Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) unassociation fails to delete Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS) in vCenter 

Symptom
After removing a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) configuration or removing a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) domain from an End Point Group (EPG), the associated virtual port groups or DVS are not removed from the vCenter configuration.

Verification

Check to see that the port groups are not currently in use by a virtual machine network adapter.

This can be verified from the vCenter GUI, by accessing the settings for a virtual machine and individually inspecting the network backing for the vNIC adapters



Another mechanism by which this can be verified is by inspecting the DVS settings, and viewing the Virtual Machines that are associated with the DVS.



The list of virtual machines that are currently using a distributed virtual port group can also be found using the APIC GUI, by navigating to the VM Networking section, navigating into the Provider, the Domain, into the DVS, the expanding the port groups, and looking at each individual port group.



To resolve this particular issue, the backing on the Virtual Machine VNICs must be removed. This can be accomplished by either removing the Virtual Adapter entirely, or by changing the Virtual Adapter network backing to one that is not present on the DVS, including a local standard virtual switch or some other DVP.

 

Problem Description

Virtual Machine Manager hosted VMs are unable to reach the fabric, get learned by the fabric or reach their default gateway through a UCS Fabric Interconnect.

Symptom
Checking the endpoint table on the fabric does not show any new endpoints being learned, although the Distributed Virtual Port groups are being created on the vSwitch and VMs.

The VMs are unable to ping their gateway or other VMs

Verification

For these symptoms the first step is to check to see if the endpoint table on the leaf to which the UCS is attached is learning any endpoints in the EPG. The MAC address for the VM in question is 00:50:56:BB:D5:08, and it is unable to reach its default gateway

 
. 
 
Upon inspecting the "show endpoint detail" output on the leaf, the MAC for the VM is missing from the output.

+---------------+---------------+-----------------+--------------+-------------+------------------------------+
 
Additionally, viewing the output of "show vlan" and grepping for the Test EPG, the interface that is expected to be configured with the EPG is not visible in the interfaces that the policy should be programmed on. 

 
rtp_leaf1# show vlan | grep Test
 39   Test:CommerceWorkspaceTest:Web   active    Eth1/42, Eth1/44, Po1 
 
Inspecting the configuration on the Attachable Entity Profile for the interface group used on the UCS shows that no vSwitch policy is configured for the LLDP, CDP or LACP policies. Without these policies, the defaults will be inherited from the AEP itself, and as a result will be configured to run LLDP using whatever link aggregation protocol is used on the upstream links. This will cause the VDS to inherit these properties, and thus run incorrectly.

 

 
By right clicking on the Attachable Entity Profile and clicking the "Config vSwitch Policies" it is possible to associate override policies for the vSwitch. When using a UCS between the leaf and ESX hosts, these should be configured to disable LLDP, enable CDP and use Mac Pinning as the LACP policy, as shown below:

 

 
With the override in place, inspecting the endpoint table on the switch itself shows that the MAC address for the VM has been learned and the VLAN table shows that the interface where the EPG can be learned is correctly placed in the CommerceWorkspaceTest:Web EPG.

 
rtp_leaf1# show vlan | grep Test

Further verification from the host itself shows that ping to the gateway is successful.

 

Overview

This chapter covers the common troubles encountered during L4-L7 service insertion with the ACI fabric. An overview of what should happen and the verification steps used to confirm a working L4-L7 service insertion are covered first. The displays taken on a working fabric can then be used as an aid in troubleshooting issues when service graph and device cluster deployment failed.

The Cisco ACI and the APIC controller are designed with the ability to provide automated service insertion while acting as a central point of policy control within the ACI fabric. ACI policies manage both the network fabric and services appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, etc. The policy controller has the ability to configure the network automatically to allow traffic to flow through the service devices. In addition, the policy controller can also automatically configure the service devices according to the application service requirements. This approach allows organizations to automate infrastructure configuration coordinated with service insertion and eliminate the challenge of managing all the complex traffic-steering techniques that are used by traditional service insertion configuration methods.

When a service graph is defined though the APIC GUI, the concept of "functions" are used to specify how traffic should flow between the consumer EPG and the provider EPG. These functions can be exposed as firewall, load balancer, SSL offload, etc. and APIC will translate these function definitions into selectable elements of a service graph through a technique called rendering. Rendering involves the allocation of the fabric resources, such as bridge domain, service device IP addresses, etc. to ensure the consumer and provider EPGs will have all necessary resources and configuration to be functional. 

Device Package
The APIC needs to communicate with the service devices to define and configure the user-specific functions according to the “communcations method” the service device understands. This method of translation happens between the APIC and service devices by utilizing a plug-in or device package installed by the administrator. The device package also includes a description of the functions supported by the device package and the mode that the service device is utilizing. In ACI terminology, a service appliance can operate in two modes:

Go-To Mode - aka Routed mode. Examples include L3 routed firewall or load balancer, or one-arm load balancer.
Go-Through Mode - Transparent mode. An example would be a transparent L2, or bridged) firewall.
The illustration below shows some examples of device package functions.

 

 
Service Graph Definition
When the service graph definitions are being configured, the abstract graph needs to stitch together the consumer and provider contract. The connectors between the Function Node have two connector types:

L2 - Layer 2 connector. Example includes ACI fabric that has L2 adjacency between EPG and the transparent firewall's inside interface. 
L3 - Layer 3 connector with Unicast routing. Example: ACI fabric will act as the default gateway the outside interface of the ASA transparent firewall. 
Node name - this will be used later on during before the service graph is rendered.

Adjacency

Function Type

BD Selection

L2

Go-To

Disable routing on BD if the routing is disabled for the connection.

L3

Go-To

Routing must also be enabled within the BD.

L2

Go-Through

Disable routing on BD if the routing is disabled for the connection. 

L3

 Go-Through

 Routing settings on “shadow” BD is set as per the routing on connection.

Once the abstract graph is instantiated, the function of the service devices can be configured via GUI, REST or CLI. These functions include firewall or load balancer configurations such as IP addresses of the interfaces, access-list, load balancer monitoring policy, virtual IP, etc.

The illustration below shows the L4-L7 Function mode and empty Service Parameters.



 

Concrete Device and Logical Device
The service graph also contains the abstract node information. The APIC will translate the definition and functions from the abstract graph into the concrete devices that are connected onto the ACI fabric. This may raise the question of why there is a logical device and a concrete device.  The way this works is the concrete devices are the standalone appliance nodes, but the devices are typically deployed as a cluster, or pair, which is represented as a logical clustered device.  

The following parameters are mandatory to create the Concrete Device:

Device identity such as IP address and login credential of the concrete device.
Logical interface to actual interface mapping, including guest VM virtual network adapter name.
The following parameters are mandatory to create the Logical Device Cluster:

Select the device type - physical or virtual.
Device identity such as IP address and login credential of the logical device.
Logical interface name and function.
The illustration below shows the Logical Device Cluster configuration screen.


 
Device Cluster Selector Policies
The last step before the service graph can be rendered is to associate the service graph with the appropriate contract and logical device.  For example, the Create Logical Device Context screen is where the association of contract, graph, node and cluster is built between the "PermitWeb" contract, "Web" graph, "Web-FW" node, "Prod/Web-FW" device cluster. 

The illustration below shows the Logical Device Context configuration.



Rendering the Service Graph
In order to render the service graph, association needs to happen between the appropriate contract and subject to the correct L4-L7 Service Graph.

If the service graph is able to deploy, the service graph instance and virtual device will be seen as deployed in "Deployed Service Graphs" and "Deployed Device Clusters". The illustration shows the working and rendered service graph.

The illustration below shows where to attach the service graph to the contract.



 

Problem Description

The service graph is not rendering and will not deploy after the service graph is attached to a contract.

Symptom 1
When clicking the logical device cluster, the Device State is in "init" state. 

Verification

The "init" state indicates there is a communication issue - the APIC controller cannot communicate with the service device. Faults under the Logical Device context should be seen. A following fault code from an ASA logical device context shows communication between APIC and service device:

F0324 Major script error : Connection error : HTTPSConnectionPool(host='10.122.254.39', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /admin/exec/show%20version%20%7C%20grep%20Cisco%20Adaptive%20Security%20Appliance%20Software%20Version (Caused by <class 'socket.error'>: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable)

This fault can be resolved by verifying the connectivity between the APIC and the service device with the following:

Ping the service device from the APIC CLI to verify reachability
Verify login credentials to the service device with the username and password supplied in the device configuration
Verify the device's virtual IP and port is open
Verify username and password is correct in the APIC configuration
 
Symptom 2
After correcting connectivity issues between the APIC and the service device, it can be seen that a F0765 CDev configuration is invalid due to cdev-missing-virtual-info fault has occurred. 

Verification

After verification of the network connectivity between APIC and the service appliance (in this case the service appliance is a VM), it is necessary to ensure the service VM name matches the vCenter console, and the vCenter name matches the Data Center name.

Symptom 3
Seeing a fault defined as F0772 LIf configuration is invalid due to LIf-invalid-CIf in the Logical Device context.

Verification

First, it is necessary to define what are the items indicated called the LIf and the CIf. LIf is the logical interface and CIf is a concrete interface. With this particular fault, the Logical interface is the element that is not rendering properly. This is where the Function Node maps the logical interface to the actual, or concrete, interface to form a relationship. F0772 means one of the following:

The Logical interface is not created
The Logical interface is not mapped to the correct concrete interface.
Symptom 4
After fixing the previous fault, F0772, there may be an additional fault, F0765 Cdev configuration is invalid due to cdev-missing-cif.  

Verification

This fault indicates that the CIf, concrete interface, is missing from the concrete device. This can be checked under the concrete device configuration under L4-L7 Services->Device Clusters->Logical Device->Device->Policy to verify the necessary concrete interfaces have been configured.

Symptom 5
When deploying the service graph, it is possible to see a fault defined as F0758 Service graph could not be rendered due to following: id-allocation-failure.

Verification

When deploying service device VMs in a hypervisor, these devices are like the normal virtual machine creation in that they will be placed into their own EPG that is mapped to the BD where the VM resides. When the service graph is rendered by the APIC, it will allocate the VLANs from the VMM pool assigned during logical device cluster creation. If the dynamic VLAN pool that is associated with the VMM does not have enough VLANs allocated, it will fail and raise fault F0758.

This error can be corrected by allocating additional VLANs into the dynamic VLAN pool that is used by the VMM.

Symptom 6
All faults seem to be cleared but the service graph will still not render, and no faults are raised. In addition, verification of the contract shows it has been associated with the appropriate service graph. The filter is also defined and associated to the correct contract.

Verification

Go to consumer EPG or External Bridge Network and the provider EPG. It needs to have configured the correct EPG or External Bridge Network as the consumer and provider. If the EPG is configured as both consumer and provider, the L4-L7 graph will not be rendered.

Symptom 7
The service graph is trying to render, but it fails and raises the fault F0758 Service graph could not be rendered due to following: missing-mandatory-param.

Verification

This fault is associated with the Function Node configuration. It would be caused by one or more missing mandatory parameters, or one or more missing mandatory device configuration parameters:

Check the Function Node configuration and verify if any Mandatory parameter with “true” is missing.
Check under the actual service device configuration and identify if any Mandatory parameter is missing. One example might be seen when configuring the ASA firewall and the “order” parameter the access control entry is a required field even thought it is not marked as required. 
Symptom 8
In the example the Cisco ASAv is being used, and traffic is not passing through the service device. After inspecting the Deployed Device Cluster, there is a fault, F0324 Major script error: Configuration error:.

Verification

This fault is related to the Function Node configuration and it indicates that a passed configured parameter in rendering was not accepted by the service device. Examples might include configuring ASAv transparent mode in the policy while the firewall is configured in routed mode, or configuring the ASAv security level to 200 when the only acceptable values are from 0 to 100.
